"UGA","Uganda","Uganda","Republic of Uganda","UG","Ugandan shilling","The reporting period for national accounts data is designated as either calendar year basis (CY) or fiscal year basis (FY). For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: June 30). Also, an estimate (PA.NUS.ATLS) of the exchange rate covers the same period and thus differs from the official exchange rate (CY). In addition, the World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to 1960-2009. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.","Sub-Saharan Africa","Low income","UG","2017",NA,"Value added at basic prices (VAB)","IDA","HIPC","Country uses the 2008 System of National Accounts methodology",NA,NA,"BPM6","Actual","General trade system","Consolidated central government","Enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS)","2014","Demographic and Health Survey 2016","Integrated household survey (IHS), 2015/16","","2008-2009",2000,2018,NA
