# intro_to_data_vis_lab_5_leveragingAI
This is my 5th lab for the intro to data visualization class. In this class we are assigned to work with AI to create some visualizations given data.

(You, 10 points) data preparation. Generate the small and the large scale CSV.  
  
  I did the data preparation in R, the code will be attatched as a screenshot.
  
(You, 15 points) apply core vis principles to begin with a task and use one task only.
Start by choosing a question youâ€™d like a visualization to answer. e.g., what is the country with the largest life-expectancy? or is there a correlation between life expectancy and region over the year? Is there outlier in the data?   

The task I would like a visualization to answer the question: How does GDP per Capita vary across regions?

(AI, 5 points) Ask AI to take the small data as an input and generate a chart and the code in D3 that can answer your question. 
(AI, 5 points) Ask AI to take the large data as an input and generate a chart and the code in D3 that can answer your question. 
(You, 10 points) Is AI aware of different data size and does it give you the same code/visualization style? 
I do think it is aware of the different size data 
(You, 15 points) After these generation step, 
practice critique AI-generated ideas and D3 code by listing the set of guidelines it should have followed, e.g., need legend when color is used; draw a different chart when you don't think the chart representation fits your task. 
(AI, 5 points) ask AI to add items you think it does not do properly one-by-one. Please fix one at a time. 
(AI + You, 20 points) ask AI to fix one-by-one. When it cannot, please fix it yourself. In this assignment, you only need to fix one of the things AI cannot fix. 
(AI, 5 points) ask AI to justify its design choices. 
(You, 10 points), what did you learn through the process? Critically evaluate
